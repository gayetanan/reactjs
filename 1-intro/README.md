# Learning the fundamentals of reactjs.

## what is react and why using it ?
React is javascript library maintained by facebook used for creating websites, web app & user interface in an organized and reusable way based on component.

## Why react ?
Using react we tackle our project with different approach. as dev we see our UI as bunch of components.

<!-- Before library,framework like react let assume we wanted to create a web page that contains 2 button technically the same button used in 2 different places with different text node.
Certainly we would duplicate the button and change the text as we wanted which would be quite messy and hard to maintain especially when we would decide to make change to that button. -->

## what is component ?
A component is piece of reusable UI. it could be a button,search bar, link, a section even a whole webpage (maybe).

components can optionally receive argument which call properties (shortly props) used to dynamically change info through them while being used in different places, and also contain state for holding infos about components, events,....
